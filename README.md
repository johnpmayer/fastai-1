# Practical Deep Learning for Coders

## Lesson 1

Homework:

- [x] Experiment with the basic models, maybe make something (and share!)
- [x] Read the book <https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb>

## Lesson 2

Did the book reading first. Binder deploy didn't work, probably because I checked
in my entire repository, and I did not check in my model. Oh well. I can come
back to this if I want to look at deployments, but I can imagine how I'd do
this for real - a python program combining the model with some microservice
framework. ~~BinderHub looks neat (and it's k8s!). This is especially promising
since running in production (which is after training) can just sit on the CPU
rather than require the crazy GPU setup. Still something to configure though.~~

- [x] Listen to the lecture
  - [ ] Deploy to huggingface instead of the above. Really excellent workflow @37:00
