# Practical Deep Learning for Coders

## Lesson 1

Homework:

- [x] Experiment with the basic models, maybe make something (and share!)
- [x] Read the book <https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynb>

## Lesson 2

Did the homework first. Binder deploy didn't work, probably because I checked
in my entire repository, and I did not check in my model. Oh well. I can come
back to this if I want to look at deployments, but I can imagine how I'd do
this for real - a python program combining the model with some microservice
framework.
